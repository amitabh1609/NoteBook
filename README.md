# NoteBook

A Note Taking App that utilizes a many-to-many relationship schema between the Note and Tag models, allowing users to organize their notes efficiently with the help of tags. Additionally, the app incorporates dynamic querying capabilities, empowering users to customize their search criteria with custom predicates, sort orders, and order by options, all of which can be updated in real-time.


## Here are some of the features of our Note Taking app:



* 1.) Organize your notes with tags: Easily organize your notes by adding tags to them. You can then search for notes by tag, making it easy to find the information you need.

* 2.) Dynamic querying: Customize your search criteria with custom predicates, sort orders, and order by options. This gives you a great deal of flexibility in how you search for notes.

* 3.) Real-time updates: All changes to your notes are updated in real time, so you can always be sure that you are working with the latest version of your data.
